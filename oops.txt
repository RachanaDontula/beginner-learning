
Python supports Functional programming
also supports object oriented programming
and procedure oriented programming too.

procedure oriented:  while working with software, code will be divided into small modules
                     those small modules will be functions.
Functional programming: without changing data, or manipulating data,
                        functions are used as mathematical functions.
oops:  trying to solve real world problems with virtual world solutions.
        eg: we need object in real world to do an work. like, calling needs mobile as an object.



objects: it contains attributes and behaviour
attribute: property/data  for defining we use variables
behaviour: actions   for defining we use methods
methods: functions in oops are called as methods

oops:  topics:
objects
class
encapsulation
polymorphism
abstraction


class: Design/ blueprint
objects: instance(real entity/ real stuff) of a class


everything is an object in python class.
to access the method/function inside class, we have to mention
'classname.methodname(objectname)' or 'objectname.methodname()'
methods change their behaviour depend upon objects
